# Contributing to SHARP-on-MCP

The SHARP-on-MCP initiative will thrive on community collaboration. We believe that an open, engaged community is essential for building a robust and widely adopted standard. Our project is licensed under the MIT License, fostering a permissive environment that encourages broad participation, rapid innovation, and seamless integration of our work into diverse applications.

We actively invite developers, healthcare professionals, researchers, and AI enthusiasts to contribute. Your expertise can help shape the future of AI agent interoperability in healthcare. We've structured two primary avenues for contribution, designed to allow for flexible engagement:

- **Enhancing the Core FHIR-Based Reference MCP Server**

We are building and maintaining a centralized, open-source reference MCP server specifically designed to interface with FHIR data. This server aims to become a comprehensive repository of common, reusable tools for healthcare AI agents.

If your goal is to contribute broadly applicable functionalities that leverage FHIR resources, you can develop and submit new tools or enhance existing ones for this reference server. Contributions here directly enrich a shared, foundational resource that will benefit the entire SHARP-on-MCP ecosystem.

- **Developing Independent MCP Servers**

Alternatively, you can contribute by developing and showcasing your own specialized MCP servers. Whether you're building a unique service that leverages FHIR data in novel ways, integrating with other healthcare data sources, or exploring entirely new use cases for AI agents, SHARP-on-MCP provides the framework for your independent creations. We encourage the sharing of these innovative servers with the community.

## The SHARP-on-MCP Bounty Program: Rewarding Collaboration

To further incentivize high-quality contributions and accelerate feature development, we are excited to launch the SHARP-on-MCP Bounty Program. This program is designed to create a vibrant, collaborative open-source environment by directly rewarding valuable contributions.

**How the Bounty Program Works:**

- **Issue Submission**: Anyone can propose new features, enhancements, or critical bug fixes by submitting a detailed issue to our community repository. An issue should clearly describe:
     - A proposed feature for the main FHIR-based MCP server (e.g., "Add tool for patient risk stratification").
     - A completely new use case or type of MCP server that would benefit the SHARP ecosystem (e.g., "Propose an MCP server for clinical trial matching").
     - A clearly defined problem or improvement.
  
- **Issue Review and Bounty Issuance**: Our core team, in collaboration with community members, will review submitted issues on an ongoing basis. Issues that are well-defined, strategically aligned with SHARP-on-MCP's vision, and demonstrate significant value will be designated with a bounty.
  
- **Development and Payment**: Once an issue has a bounty assigned, it becomes eligible for financial reward. Multiple contributors may work on the same bounty-eligible issue. The first Pull Request (PR) that is successfully merged into the main codebase, meeting the defined requirements and quality standards, will be awarded the bounty.
  
- **Who Can Submit Issues?** The program is open to everyone. You can submit an issue for a feature you intend to build yourself, or for a feature you wish to see developed by the community, with the potential for us to fund its implementation.
  
## Initial Program Funding:

To kickstart this collaborative effort, we are committing a total of **$15,000** in bounties. Individual bounties will begin at **$50**, with amounts varying based on the complexity, impact, and scope of the contribution. This initial funding aims to catalyze rapid development and demonstrate our commitment to a truly rewarding open-source experience.
