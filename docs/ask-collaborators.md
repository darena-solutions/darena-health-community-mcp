# Our Ask: Call for Collaborators

This project is 100% **open-source**, MIT-licensed, and designed to be owned by
the community. We're calling on:

-   **Developers** contribute to new MCPs or enhance the core spec
-   **Health tech companies** to help test integrations
-   **FHIR & AI experts** to refine our header schema and lifecycle architecture

By modularizing and standardizing MCP servers, we can:

-   Enable LLM apps to be portable across health systems
-   Create a marketplace of reusable, high-value MCP servers
-   Reduce duplication and speed up development cycles for AI-driven care tools

This initiative isn’t just about infrastructure; it’s about creating a scalable
ecosystem where healthcare innovation with LLMs can thrive safely, transparently,
and efficiently.

There are two ways you can collaborate:

1. Build your own MCP server supporting the standard. Publish it for testing by
   others
2. Contribute to the open-source MCP server we are developing. As outlined in 5(B),
   we are developing an open-source MCP server with standard FHIR tools for different
   platforms. You can submit a tool to any of them as PR. These servers will remain
   open source. We also have a hosted version of these servers that can be used for
   testing. We announce that the first 50 PRs to be approved and merged into this will
   be paid $x/PR. Let’s grow the tools ecosystem together.
